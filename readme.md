# Project Name: Travel App

## Introduction
The **Travel App** allows users to plan trips by entering a destination and travel date. It fetches and displays weather information, along with an image of the destination, helping users make better travel decisions.

## Features
- Input a country and a travel date to receive a weather forecast for that location.
- Fetch and display images of the destination to enhance the user experience.
- Utilize multiple APIs for location data, weather, and images.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following libraries and tools:
1. **Express.js**: Handles server-side logic.
2. **Webpack**: Bundles JavaScript files.
3. **Jest**: Used for testing.
4. **Node-fetch**: Handles API requests.
5. **HTML & CSS**: Provides front-end structure and styling.

## APIs
The project integrates the following APIs:
1. **GeoNames API**: For fetching geographical data.
2. **Weatherbit API**: For retrieving weather information based on the destination.
3. **Pixabay API**: For fetching destination images.

## Note for API Keys:
- The app uses three API keys: **Weatherbit API key**, **Pixabay API key**, and **GeoNames username**.
- The API keys used in **server.js** are stored in the **.env** file.
- To update API keys in **server.js**, modify them in the **.env** file.

## Environment Variables:
If your project requires any environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary variables there.

For example:
weatherApiKey=YOUR_API_KEY_FOR_THIS_API
pixabayApiKey=YOUR_API_KEY_FOR_THIS_API
geonamesUsername=YOUR_API_KEY_FOR_THIS_API

> Note: Here I removed `.env` from `.gitignore` file to make testing easy for you.

## Installation and Running the Project:

1. Ensure you are using **Node.js** version `v22.12.0` or higher.
   - **macOS**:  
     If you donâ€™t have **Node Version Manager (nvm)**, install it using Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install nvm
     ```

     Then, install the required **Node.js** version:
     ```bash
     nvm install 22.12.0
     ```

     To use the installed version:
     ```bash
     nvm use 22.12.0
     ```

     Optionally, set it as the default version:
     ```bash
     nvm alias default 22.12.0
     ```

   - **Windows**:  
     Download and install **nvm for Windows** from the [official release page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).
     
     Once **nvm** is installed, run the following to install the desired version of **Node.js**:
     ```bash
     nvm install 22.12.0
     ```

     Then, use the installed version:
     ```bash
     nvm use 22.12.0
     ```

     Optionally, set it as the default version:
     ```bash
     nvm alias default 22.12.0
     ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. To build the production version and see the dist files:
   ```bash
   npm run build-prod
   ```
4. To start the server and open the app on localhost:4200:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. For development mode and running the app on localhost:3000:
   ```bash
   npm run build-dev
   ```

## Tests:
- To run the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

## Deployment with Netlify:
To deploy your project on Netlify, follow these simple steps:

1. **Push your code to GitHub:** Ensure your project is pushed to a GitHub repository.

2. **Connect with Netlify:** Go to Netlify, sign up or log in, and click "New site from Git".

3. **Choose GitHub:** Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account and select the repository you want to deploy.

4. **Configure Build Settings:** For most static sites, the default build settings are sufficient. You can specify the build command (e.g., npm run build-prod) and the output directory (e.g., dist).

6. **Environment Variables:** configure the same environment variables (you have them iside .env) on Netlify by add them there.

5. **Deploy:** Click "Deploy site" and let Netlify handle the build and deployment process.

Once deployed, Netlify will provide you with a live URL, which you can use to access your site. You can also set up custom domains and automatic deployments for future updates.

   > Note: The Netlify app is not connected to the server side.

So please test the final code using this for client:

   ```bash
   npm run build-dev
   ```
and this for server side:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
